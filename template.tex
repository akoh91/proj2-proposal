\section{Proposal}
\label{sec:proposal}

In the United States, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
has announced its plan to send humans to Mars during the 2030s. This ambitious
goal requires a variety of studies be conducted to effectively plan the
endeavor. General habitation, food production, resource extraction,
communication, spacecraft, and many other areas must be studied to determine
their optimal configuration.

For our second project, we propose a simulation of population growth dynamics on
Mars, with the goal of determining an optimal strategy for sustainable
population growth. Population growth models have been extensively studied in the
literature \cite{clark1967population}, \cite{caswell2001matrix},
\cite{meadows1992beyond}, \cite{boserup1983population},
\cite{ehrlich1971impact} but generally only in the context of our own planet.
Often, natural populations without resource limitations exhibit exponential
growth \cite{audesirk1996biology}. However, this type of rapid growth will
likely be unsustainable under the extreme resource constraints of Mars.
By considering several proposed habitation models for Mars, we hope to better
understand the resource requirements of these approaches, and by that develop
recommendations for sustainable growth.

More specifically, we intend to model humans as consumer entities, and several
types of resources such as food, water, and sanitation availability as resource
entities. We intend to take a stochastic, discrete-time approach. As David
Quammen notes \cite{quammen1996song}, there are four sources of uncertainty to
which a population may be subject: demographic, environmental, natural
catastrophes, and genetic. We will attempt to model several of these to
provide the greatest realism possible.

From a programming perspective, we plan to use Scala, a hybrid
object-oriented/functional programming language that runs on the Java virtual
machine (JVM). Scala is performant, statically typed, and interoperable with
Java, making it an excellent choice for developing our simulation.
